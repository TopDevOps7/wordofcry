        WOC is an NFT based digital pet universe where players battle, raise, and trade Cryptoids. A team of 3 Cryptoids will enable players to join our sP2E game.
        Cryptoids can be bred to create offspring and can be used in battle, for breeding or marketplace trading.
        Cryptoids can breed with each other to produce superior offspring with similar traits. The maximum number of breeds will be capped at seven (7) per Cryptoid. 
        In this exciting game mode, a team of three Cryptoids will band together to defeat various monsters in increasingly challenging stages.
        $CAC will be the primary token in World of Cryptoids and will be used for various activities such as staking, breeding and purchasing NFTs.
